# 📊 Object-Oriented Programming Project – UNIVPM (2018/2019)

This repository contains a Java application developed as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming** course at Università Politecnica delle Marche (UNIVPM), academic year 2018/2019.  
The project focuses on parsing, modeling, and analyzing data from a public transport system.

## 🚀 Features

- Import and manage CSV data on bus stops, lines, and schedules
- JavaFX-based graphical user interface (GUI)
- Object-oriented design using UML principles
- Basic data analysis functionalities
- Diagrams for understanding system architecture and use cases

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Java
- JavaFX
- Eclipse IDE
- UML (Use Case, Class, Sequence Diagrams)

## 🗃️ Dataset

The dataset used for this project refers to Italian public transport systems and is available at:

**[Public Dataset – dati.gov.it](https://www.dati.gov.it/api/3/action/package_show?id=f9198f21-02b8-4479-bccc-eff18564fa8f)**

The CSV file can be downloaded via the URL provided in the JSON response.

## 📷 Screenshots & Diagrams

> The following UML diagrams are included to illustrate the structure and behavior of the system:

### Use Case Diagram
Provides an overview of the main interactions between the user and the system.

### Class Diagram
Shows the main classes of the system and their relationships.
